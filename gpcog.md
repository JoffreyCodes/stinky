-- Maria -- Zoom on 19 Jun

* See Maria's 19 Jun email -- it includes an excel file
* Excel spreadsheet -- from City of Portland -- C-click-fix app for Portland residents
  * odor reports
* Link -- Smell my City -- has directions for accessing South Portland odor complaints
  * enter zip codes of interest (South Portland has several zip codes) 
  * produces a spreadsheet for download
* Link -- ME DEP weather stations
  * located at air-sampling sites in Portland and South Portland
  * many stations, only a portion of them are online
  * look at numbers 3-7 (there's info on how to do that under the link in the email)
  * these were installed sometime in 2020 (that's when ME DEP started monitoring South Portland in particular)
* Oil terminals -- all data is in paper form
  * from ME DEP -- not ready yet -- these are faxed paper copies
  * When barges come into the Portland terminal to deliver or pick up oil -- they have to give DEP notice
  * Do odor complates link up with those events
  * Portland Pipeline -- not operating
  * Sprague and Global
  * Paper copies  no later than Friday (maybe Wednesday)
* Reach out to Luke -- he has a lot of ideas
  * He has extra input, etc., etc.

Project Idea: This Stinks

Problem: Residents of Portland and South Portland have been reporting disruptive smells in the air on certain days of the year. The cities use different platforms to report and respond to the problem: a local 311 app, and a popular crowdsourcing app used across the nation. It's been unclear what the source of the smells might be and difficult to understand the extent of the issue on both sides of the Fore River.

* Project goals.

* Coordinate the various data sources
* Clean the data and make it easily accessible for the general public
* Create some simple visualizations
* Add additional data from ME DEP (e.g., wind speed, direction, temperature, etc)
Â· Project partners
* The Greater Portland Council of Governments
* The Sierra Club
