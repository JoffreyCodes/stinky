* stinky_dataset.ipynb
  * https://github.com/ds5110/stinky/blob/master/stinky_dataset.ipynb
  * This is a fantastic notebook
    * Nice summary statement at the top that describes:
      * What it does
      * How to get raw data files in case you want to update it
    * Nicely commented throughout
    * Launches automatically in Colab and runs to completion without modification
    * Downloads a merged and cleaned file for analysis
    * This file can be compared with the version that's in github -- REPRODUCIBILITY -- YAY!!!
  * Did I mention that this is a fantastic notebook?! ;-)
* Geo_dataset.ipynb
  * https://colab.research.google.com/github/ds5110/stinky/blob/master/Geo_dataset.ipynb
  * Not yet listed in the README -- that's fine, since the notebook seems to be a work in progress
  * Doesn't launch automatically, but runs to completion on Colab
  * I'd have to dig in a bit to figure out what's going on here.
  * The "git clone" cell must be a placeholder for something that's more polished
  * My hope is that this will eventually be listed in the README.md as a stinky deliverable from the geo team
  * stinky_dataset.ipynb is an exemplar for what this notebook could become -- that would be great!
* oil_vessel_dataset.ipynb
  * https://colab.research.google.com/github/ds5110/stinky/blob/master/oil_vessel_dataset.ipynb
  * Not yet listed in the README
  * Doesn't launch automatically, but runs to completion on Colab
  * I'd have to dig in a bit to figure out what's going on here.
  * My hope is that this will eventually be listed in the README.md as another stinky deliverable
* text_analysis_caroline.ipynb
  * https://github.com/ds5110/stinky/blob/master/text_analysis_caroline.ipynb
  * Listed in the README
  * Opens automatically in Colab
  * Comment on the top (TODO list) indicates that this is a work in progress -- understood
  * Crashes in Cell 3 -- not a problem, I probably shouldn't be poking around in this file since it's a work in progress
  * The github file has some of the visualizations that you used in the final presentation -- awesome
  * It would be super fantastic if this would run to completion and reproduce those figures!
* Other .ipynb file(s)?
  * It would be super fantastic if all the figures in all the final presentations would be similarly reproducible
