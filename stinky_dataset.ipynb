Run all cells --> this will download a csv file containing df_stinky\n","3. Upload df_stinky.csv to [data folder](https://github.com/ds5110/stinky/tree/master/data). (Do not need to delete old df_stinky.csv file; GitHub will automatically replace with new file.)\n","\n","Note: if updated data for SCF is sent through new, separate Excel spreadsheets, the code for loading data will need to be edited (e.g. how raw data for oil vessel arrivals is loaded in [oil_vessels_data.ipynb](https://github.com/ds5110/stinky/blob/master/oil_vessel_dataset.ipynb))"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ZxLOxKD--OLb"},"source":["# Portland and S Portland zip codes included in current SMC and SCF raw data\n","\n","*   Portland\n","  *   04101, 04102: Portland immediately north of Fore River\n","  *   04103: Portland, further north (to northern border of the city)\n","  *   04108: Portland, islands to the east (Peaks Island and Cushing Island)\n","  *   04124: Portland, west of airport \n","\n","*   South Portland\n","  *   04106, 04107: S Portland immediately south of Fore River\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":237},"id":"sBjQ1XP7ZYLo","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1629682088700,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":556,"user":{"displayName":"Caroline Craig","photoUrl":"","userId":"01819851359581697486"}},"outputId":"9ccaeb74-9526-4746-f5ab-58d65dbd4331"},"source":["import pandas as pd\n","\n","# load SMC data\n","url_all_zips = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ds5110/stinky/master/smell_data/smell_raw_data/smc.csv'\n","df_smc = pd.read_csv(url_all_zips)\n","print(df_smc.shape)\n","\n","# the first rows of df_smc look like this\n","df_smc.head()"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["(2612, 9)\n"],"name":"stdout"},{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>epoch time</th>\n","      <th>date &amp; time</th>\n","      <th>smell value</th>\n","      <th>skewed latitude</th>\n","      <th>skewed longitude</th>\n","      <th>zipcode</th>\n","      <th>smell description</th>\n","      <th>symptoms</th>\n","      <th>additional comments</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>1558531873</td>\n","      <td>05/22/2019 09:31:13 -04:00</td>\n","      <td>3</td>\n","      <td>43.6608</td>\n","      <td>-70.2498</td>\n","      <td>4101</td>\n","      <td>Grainy / malt like - coming from St. John street</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <td>1558691615</td>\n","      <td>05/24/2019 05:53:35 -04:00</td>\n","      <td>3</td>\n","      <td>43.6435</td>\n","      <td>-70.2702</td>\n","      <td>4102</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>2</th>\n","      <td>1559178135</td>\n","      <td>05/29/2019 21:02:15 -04:00</td>\n","      <td>3</td>\n","      <td>43.6466</td>\n","      <td>-70.2770</td>\n","      <td>4102</td>\n","      <td>Asphalty</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>3</th>\n","      <td>1559341934</td>\n","      <td>05/31/2019 18:32:14 -04:00</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>43.6325</td>\n","      <td>-70.2828</td>\n","      <td>4106</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>4</th>\n","      <td>1559387558</td>\n","      <td>06/01/2019 07:12:38 -04:00</td>\n","      <td>3</td>\n","      <td>43.6343</td>\n","      <td>-70.2825</td>\n","      <td>4106</td>\n","      <td>Oil fumes</td>\n","      <td>Throat irritation</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div>"],"text/plain":["   epoch time  ... additional comments\n","0  1558531873  ...
