# About smellmycity data
* Oil data: any update on whether we will have access to the paper data from oil barges (tracking their arrival/departure from the port)?

# About environmental data
* Since this data is more general, it would be helpful to get insights from GPCOG and Sierra Club that would help us focus.
  * Are there specific questions about the weather reports that you'd like answers to?

# About project goals / deliverables wish-list from the GPCOG and Sierra Club
* What are the questions that you'd like us to answer?
