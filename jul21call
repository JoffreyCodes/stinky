## Questions for July 21 call with Prof Bogden and Maria Guerra from GPCOG

# About smellmycity data
* Oil data: any update on whether we will have access to the paper data from oil barges (tracking their arrival/departure from the port)?

# About environmental data
* Since this data is more general, it would be helpful to get insights from GPCOG and Sierra Club that would help us focus.
  * Are there specific questions about the weather reports that you'd like answers to?

# About project goals / deliverables wish-list from the GPCOG and Sierra Club: What are the questions that you'd like us to answer? Here are a few guesses - could you help us refine these?
* Cause of the odor (e.g. oil barges, sewage issue)
* Geographical concentration of the odor

# About SCF Odor Report (xlsx file in github)
* Does this come from the Sierra Club?
* Date range: 7/1/2020 - 6/2/2021. Is this the full date range? Will we get updated data?
